  The reason for this obtuse logic is because Shopify wonâ€™t let you iterate through pages.
  Because of the need to add / remove team members over time, setting team members up as the
  `artisans` blog, strangely, met the needs better than pages did. Hence this nonsense.

{% unless blog.handle == 'artisans' %}

    Standard article layout
  {% endcomment %}
  {% include 'article' %}

{% else %}
  {% comment %}
    Team member layout
  {% endcomment %}
  {% include 'artisan' %}
{% endunless %}
